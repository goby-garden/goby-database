I intend for this to be the core module Goby uses to represent and manipulate the data structure of a project, which is stored as an SQLite database

Directory:
* `notes.md` is my running notes doc for the project.
* `index.js` is the main script (warning, lots of currently non-functional unfinished code)
* `sandbox.js` is an open testing and working environment


### [WARNING: NOT YET STABLE]

For anyone installing this, beware that it’s not ready/intended for general use yet!! I publish this package so that I can install it in [goby-interface](https://github.com/goby-garden/goby-interface) (I can’t use `npm link` because of some convoluted electron node issues), and frequently release tiny edits to accomodate my work there. 

But anyway if you _are_ one of the ~150+ (???) people who have been installing this, I’d be very curious to hear what you’re doing or what interested you in the project :)
